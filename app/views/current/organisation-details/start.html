                <p>
                    Ofgem is now the regulator for heat networks in Great Britain. The operation and supply of heat (including hot water and cooling) from a heat network is now a regulated activity that requires authorisation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you supply more than one customer using a single source of heat, you are running a heat network.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You now need to register any heat networks with Ofgem, even if you have registered with OPSS in the past.
                </p>

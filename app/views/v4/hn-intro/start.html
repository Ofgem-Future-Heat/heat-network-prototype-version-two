                <p>
                    A heat network is a system in which heating, cooling or hot water is generated at a central source and supplied to customers through a network serving either multiple buildings or multiple occupants in a single building.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Heat network operation and heat supply are now regulated activities and require authorisation for each heat network. This is obtained by registering your heat network with Ofgem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the heat network is not yet operational, it must be registered and authorised by Ofgem before it commences operation and the supply of heat to consumers.
                </p>

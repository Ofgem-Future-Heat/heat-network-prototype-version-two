<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you only control part of a relevant heat network</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">You may have arrived here because you only control part of a heat network, for example some distribution pipework. In that case, whilst the wider heat network is considered a relevant heat network, your part of it is not.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You'll need to tell the primary operator on the network to contact Ofgem and we'll advise you on how to prepare a joint submission: heat-networks@ofgem.gov.uk</p>
